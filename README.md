# DinosaurRun

This is a school project of mine and my first 2D game in Java.
It is kind of a replica of the mini-game in Chrome when you're offline.

If you somehow stumbled upon this and see some room for improvement
regarding code-quality or best practices and it's nothing exclusive for Java pros,
you're welcome to create a pull request or an issue. :)  
This project is not meant to be feature-complete or a perfect replica, though.
So not really interested in that. I would be interested in learning how to better code in Java.
